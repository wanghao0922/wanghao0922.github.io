## About Me
I am currently working as an Embodied AI Algorithm Engineer at [CowaRobot)](https://www.cowarobot.com/home), based in Shanghai, China, where I focus on <span style="color:darkred"><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong></span> for wheeled-legged robots, humanoids, robotic arm and quadrupeds. Additionally, I am actively involved in [UMI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10329) and **VLA** to advance robotic manipulation.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Armored Vehicle Engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://me.bit.edu.cn/) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Chaoyang Jiang](https://cjiang01.github.io/), with a research focus on MPC-based **trajectory tracking control** for autonomous vehicles. I subsequently obtained my Master’s degree in Engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://xjjg.bit.edu.cn/) in 2025, advised by Prof. [Zeang Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSN5VbMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), in collaboration with [Direct Drive Tech](https://directdrive.com/), where I worked on **RL-based locomotion policy** for bipedal–wheeled robot named [Diablo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21500).

During my graduate studies, I completed an internship at [JD.com](https://about.jd.com/company/), focusing on the development of a **vision-based teleoperation** framework for the [RealMan robotic arm](https://www.realman-robotics.cn/products/rmo) and [LeapHand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06440). Since August 2025, I have been working at [CowaRobot)](https://www.cowarobot.com/business/humanoid), where I have successfully deployed RL policies on multiple self-research robotic platforms. My work also involves building teleoperation systems and VLA pilelines, covering data collection, algorithm development, and deployment.

Throughout my academic and industrial journey, I have developed strong **sim2real** expertise, with hands-on experience in end-to-end deployment of control and learning systems—from simulation and training to real-world execution—across diverse robotic platforms, including **wheel-legged robots**, **humanoid robots**, **robotic arm**, **dexterous Hand**, **quadrupeds** and **autonomous vehicles**.

<summary style="margin-bottom: 0;">Beyond academics and research... <em></em> </summary> I am <strong>outgoing and curious, always eager to meet interesting people😊 and through them discover new perspectives</strong> on the world around me🌟. In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton 🏸, singing 🎶, photography 📷, and traveling ✈️.
